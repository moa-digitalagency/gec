# GEC Mines - Mail Management System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application for managing mail correspondence at GEC (SecrÃ©tariat GÃ©nÃ©ral des Mines). The system allows users to register, view, search, and manage mail documents with file attachments, providing a complete digital mail tracking solution.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design preferences: Clean, corporate design using Democratic Republic of Congo colors (blue, yellow, red, green) with Tailwind CSS.
Dashboard design: User confirmed perfect and should not be changed ("le design est parfait, le tableau de board j'adore ne change sauf").

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Flask-SQLAlchemy integration
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for session management
- **Database**: SQLite (default) with PostgreSQL support via environment configuration
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with configurable upload directory
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab for document export functionality

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 (Flask's default)
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS (replaced Bootstrap for cleaner corporate design)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.0.0
- **Tables**: DataTables 1.13.6 for enhanced table functionality
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with jQuery for DataTables integration
- **Design System**: Democratic Republic of Congo colors (RDC blue: #003087, yellow: #FFD700, red: #CE1126, green: #009639)

### Security Features
- Password hashing using Werkzeug's security utilities
- Session-based authentication with Flask-Login
- File upload validation with allowed extensions
- CSRF protection through Flask's session management
- Proxy fix middleware for secure deployment

## Key Components

### Models (models.py)
- **User**: User authentication and profile management
- **Courrier**: Mail correspondence tracking with metadata
- **LogActivite**: Activity logging for audit trails
- **ParametresSysteme**: System configuration (logo, software name, receipt number format)

### Views (views.py)
- Authentication routes (login/logout)
- Dashboard with statistics
- Mail registration and viewing
- Search functionality
- File handling and exports
- Settings management with customizable parameters

### Utilities (utils.py)
- File validation and handling
- Unique ID generation for mail tracking
- Activity logging system
- PDF export functionality

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in through Flask-Login system
2. **Mail Registration**: New mail entries are created with optional file attachments
3. **File Storage**: Uploaded files are stored in the `uploads/` directory
4. **Database Operations**: All data is persisted through SQLAlchemy ORM
5. **Activity Logging**: User actions are tracked in the LogActivite table
6. **Search & Export**: Users can search mail records and export to PDF

- Defaults to SQLite for development, easily switchable to PostgreSQL

### File System Requirements
- `uploads/` directory for file storage (auto-created)
- `exports/` directory for PDF exports
- Static assets served from `static/` directory

### Production Considerations
- ProxyFix middleware configured for reverse proxy deployment
- Connection pooling configured for database efficiency
- File size limits set to 16MB
